Description: Quick Charts - development files
 A QtQuick plugin providing high-performance charts (gpu-accelerated).
 .
 It supports three different chart types: pie, line and bar, which can be fed
 from multiple types of data sources. There is also support for axis labels, an
 axis grid and a legend.  Additionally, there is a submodule that contains some
 convenience items.
 .
 The pie and line charts are rendered using a technique called signed
 distance fields, which allows efficient GPU-accelerated rendering of 2D
 shapes without loss of quality.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
